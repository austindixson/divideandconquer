# Divide and Conquer

**Your Claude Code tasks finish 2-3x faster. Drop in one skill and Claude starts parallelizing automatically.**

## The Problem

You ask Claude to build a feature. It does the database, then the API, then the frontend, then the tests — one thing at a time. You watch and wait while it works through a queue that didn't need to be a queue.

Half that work could have been running simultaneously.

## The Fix

Install this skill and Claude starts thinking in parallel by default. It figures out which pieces of your task are independent, launches them all at once, and only waits when something genuinely depends on something else.

A 9-step feature build becomes 4 waves of concurrent work. Same result, fraction of the wall-clock time.

## Divide. Then Conquer.

The name isn't just clever — it's literally what happens in two acts.

### The Divide

You hand Claude a big job. Before touching any code, it splits that job apart.

Not randomly — it looks at every piece and asks: *"Does this piece actually need to wait for anything else, or can it start right now?"*

Most of the time, the answer is surprising. Building the frontend doesn't need the backend to exist yet — it just needs to agree on what the data looks like. Writing tests doesn't need the code to exist yet — you can write the test first and fill in the code after. Research tasks *never* need to wait for each other.

So Claude maps out which pieces depend on which, and groups the independent ones together into **waves** — batches of work that can all happen at the same time.

Think of it like planning a house build. You don't wait for the electrician to finish before calling the plumber. They work different rooms at the same time. The only thing you *actually* wait for is the foundation — everything else can overlap.

### The Conquer

Now Claude attacks each wave all at once. It spins up multiple workers (subagents), hands each one a clear job description, and lets them run simultaneously.

Wave 1 finishes. Everything that was waiting on Wave 1 can now go — Wave 2 launches, again all at once. And so on until everything's done.

Then it pulls all the results together, checks that nothing conflicts, runs the tests, and reviews the code. One clean delivery.

**The divide is the thinking. The conquer is the doing. Both happen automatically — you just describe what you want.**

Here's what that looks like step by step:

1. **You describe what you want** — "Build me X" or "Fix this bug" or "Refactor these files"
2. **Claude breaks your request into small pieces** — What can be researched? What can be coded independently? What depends on what?
3. **Claude figures out what can happen at the same time** — Research tasks don't need to wait for each other. The frontend and backend can be built in parallel if they agree on data shapes upfront.
4. **Claude launches multiple workers simultaneously** — Instead of doing tasks 1 through 10 in order, it runs tasks 1, 2, and 3 at the same time, then 4, 5, and 6 together once 1-3 finish, and so on.
5. **Claude merges everything together and verifies it works** — Runs tests, checks for conflicts, reviews the code.

The result: tasks that would take 10 sequential steps finish in 3-4 "waves" of parallel work. That's a real wall-clock speedup.

### A Quick Example

You say: *"Add a /analytics endpoint with rate limiting and tests"*

Without Divide and Conquer, Claude does 9 steps one after another.

With Divide and Conquer:

| Wave | What Happens (all at the same time) |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| **Wave 1** | Research API patterns + Research rate limiting + Define data types |
| **Wave 2** | Build the database query + Build the endpoint + Set up rate limiting |
| **Wave 3** | Write unit tests + Write integration tests + Write rate limit tests |
| **Wave 4** | Code review + Security review |

**9 tasks in 4 waves instead of 9 sequential steps.** Roughly 2-3x faster.

## Two Flavors

This skill comes in two formats:

| Format | Where It Works | Best For |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Claude Code Skill** | [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) | Daily coding with Claude Code |
| **OpenClaw Skill** | [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw) / API-based agents | Custom agent platforms, API integrations |

You can install one or both. They teach the same strategy, just packaged for different environments.

## Installation

### Claude Code Skill

The Claude Code version is a `SKILL.md` file that Claude loads when it detects a task that would benefit from parallel execution.

#### Option 1: Copy the files (recommended)

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/RuneweaverStudios/divideandconquer.git

# Copy the Claude Code skill to your global skills directory
cp -r divideandconquer/claude-code-skill ~/.claude/skills/divideandconquer
```

That's it. Next time you start Claude Code and give it a complex task, it will automatically use the skill.

#### Option 2: Symlink (stays up to date with the repo)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RuneweaverStudios/divideandconquer.git ~/tools/divideandconquer

ln -s ~/tools/divideandconquer/claude-code-skill ~/.claude/skills/divideandconquer
```

Now you can `git pull` to get updates.

#### Verify it's installed

Start Claude Code and type:

```
/divideandconquer
```

If it shows up in the skill list, you're good.

#### Optional: Add a global rule to always use it

Create `~/.claude/rules/common/divideandconquer.md`:

```markdown
# Divide and Conquer — Default Execution Strategy

For ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps, multiple files, or independent subtasks),
use the `divideandconquer` skill BEFORE starting implementation.
Parallel is the default. Serial requires justification.
```

This tells Claude to proactively use the skill even when you don't explicitly ask for it.

---

### OpenClaw Skill

The OpenClaw version includes a Python-based DAG engine (`decompose.py`) that handles the graph math — topological sorting, wave computation, critical path analysis, and speedup estimation.

#### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RuneweaverStudios/divideandconquer.git

# Copy the OpenClaw skill to your skills directory
cp -r divideandconquer/openclaw-skill/divideandconquer /path/to/your/openclaw/skills/
```

#### Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (for the `decompose.py` engine)
- No external dependencies — standard library only

#### Standalone Usage (the DAG engine)

You can use `decompose.py` directly to plan parallel execution:

```bash
python scripts/decompose.py --plan '[
  {"id":1, "desc":"Define types",       "deps":[],    "category":"code"},
  {"id":2, "desc":"Research WebSocket",  "deps":[],    "category":"research"},
  {"id":3, "desc":"Build API endpoint",  "deps":[1],   "category":"code"},
  {"id":4, "desc":"Build UI component",  "deps":[1],   "category":"code"},
  {"id":5, "desc":"Wire integration",    "deps":[3,4], "category":"code"},
  {"id":6, "desc":"Write tests",         "deps":[5],   "category":"test"}
]'
```

Output:
```
## Execution Plan

### Wave 1 (parallel, 2 agents) ~~ No dependencies
- [1] Define types
- [2] Research WebSocket [Explore]

### Wave 2 (parallel, 2 agents) ~~ Depends on Wave 1
- [3] Build API endpoint
- [4] Build UI component

### Wave 3 (1 agent) ~~ Depends on Wave 2
- [5] Wire integration

### Wave 4 (1 agent) ~~ Depends on Wave 3
- [6] Write tests

Summary:
- Parallelism: 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 6 tasks across 4 waves
- Speedup: ~1.5x
- Critical path length: 4
```

You can also validate a dependency graph for cycles:

```bash
python scripts/decompose.py --validate '[
  {"id":1, "desc":"A", "deps":[2]},
  {"id":2, "desc":"B", "deps":[1]}
]'
# Output: {"valid": false, "error": "Dependency graph contains a cycle"}
```

## How It Works Under the Hood

### The 5 Phases

1. **Decompose** — Break the task into atomic subtasks across five dimensions: code, research, tests, config, and docs.

2. **Map Dependencies** — For each subtask, figure out what it genuinely depends on. The skill aggressively challenges false dependencies (e.g., "tests need implementation" — no, test skeletons can be written first).

3. **Plan Waves** — Group independent subtasks into waves. Wave 1 is everything with no dependencies. Wave 2 is everything that only depends on Wave 1. And so on.

4. **Execute** — Launch all tasks in each wave simultaneously using Claude's Agent tool (in Claude Code) or `sessions_spawn` (in OpenClaw). Each wave finishes before the next one starts.

5. **Merge & Verify** — Collect all results, resolve any conflicts, run tests, check code coverage, and do a code review.

### Smart Sizing

Not every task needs the full treatment:

| Task Size | What Happens |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Tiny** (1-2 steps) | Just does it directly. No overhead. |
| **Small** (3-5 steps) | Quick mental split, maybe 2-3 parallel agents. |
| **Medium** (5-10 steps) | Full wave plan shown to you before execution. |
| **Large** (10+ steps) | Full plan with checkpoints between phases. |

### Built-in Safety

- **Worktree isolation** — When two parallel workers might edit the same file, they get their own copy of the code. Changes are merged afterward.
- **Test gate** — Won't call the job done unless tests exist and pass (80%+ coverage target).
- **Code review gate** — Automatically dispatches a review agent on all changed files before presenting results.

## FAQ

**Q: Does this actually make things faster?**
A: Yes. The speedup depends on how much parallelism exists in your task. A task with 9 independent research steps gets close to 9x speedup. A task that's mostly sequential (step 2 needs step 1, step 3 needs step 2...) gets modest improvement, mainly from parallelizing the initial research phase. The skill is honest about this — it shows you the expected speedup before executing.

**Q: What if I don't want it to parallelize?**
A: The skill checks task size first. Trivial tasks (1-2 steps) are executed directly. You can also just tell Claude "do this sequentially" and it will.

**Q: Does this work on Claude.ai (the website)?**
A: The planning and decomposition work everywhere. The parallel *execution* requires Claude Code's Agent tool (subagents). On Claude.ai, the skill still gives you a structured plan, but executes the waves one at a time.

**Q: Will parallel agents conflict with each other?**
A: The skill handles this with git worktrees — parallel agents that might edit the same file work in isolated copies. Changes are merged afterward, one at a time, with build checks between each merge.
